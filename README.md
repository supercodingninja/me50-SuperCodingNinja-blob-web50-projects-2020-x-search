## Repository Description
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
A simple design of a front-end, consisting of three pages entitled, <span style="color:red">*Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search*</span>, where I wrote forms that should send data to an existing web server: in this case, Google’s.

## Repositiory End-Goal Criteria
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
Make it a point to tackle new code, weekly (at least, periodically); and break it down.  Try to understand new concepts, myself.  This only makes me more credible, and a stronger developer: because I've taken the time to study!  Remembering this also, as a developer, my goal should be to design NEW experiences that make people's lives simple; because as developers, we solve problems that people didn't even know they had- even better, in a way that they do not understand.  I am a superhero of tomorrow: I am The Super Coding Ninja; so I will get coding, stay on task, get ahead, and change my world!
